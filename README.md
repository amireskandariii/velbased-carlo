# Fluid Simulation with Taichi

This project is a fluid simulation implemented in Taichi, based on the paper "[Velocity-Based Monte Carlo Fluids](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3641519.3657405?casa_token=1d0Hs9JNiz4AAAAA:FcUWpr7VOmo2h2RCtnMU58Go_kOqL8gAgBW7lrnD2RzV4_54rLX94s7Gb-FNCIjJ2zWNpSGficoqBIE)".

# Features

- *3D Smoke Density Field*: Initialized in a central region, smoke rises due to buoyancy forces.
- *Velocity and Advection*: Smoke moves based on velocity fields updated each step.
- *2D Visualization*: The 3D density is projected into 2D for display.

# Current Status

- *In Progress*: Development is ongoing to refine advection and visualization.
- **Known Issues**: Visualization adjustments are needed for clarity.
